# Dynamic Deep Network Models and Applications

This project aims to explore and implement Dynamic Deep Network models for Machine Learning. These models involve "on the fly" training and inference, enabling continuous adaptation as new training data becomes available. This approach is particularly valuable when dealing with changing data distributions over time, requiring models to be continuously updated to match the evolving distribution. In this project, we will apply the dynamic methodology to a few practical use cases.

## Background

Traditional machine learning models are typically trained on static datasets with fixed distributions. However, in real-world scenarios, the underlying data distribution can change over time due to various factors such as seasonality, trends, or shifts in user behavior. When these changes occur, the performance of static models can deteriorate significantly. Dynamic Deep Network models offer a solution by allowing models to adapt and learn from new data as it becomes available.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Develop Dynamic Deep Network models that can perform "on the fly" training and inference.
2. Investigate the performance of these models in scenarios where the training data distribution is changing over time.
3. Implement continuous model updates to match the evolving data distribution.
4. Apply the dynamic methodology to practical use cases and evaluate its effectiveness.

## Methodology

To achieve the project objectives, we will follow these steps:

1. Review relevant literature on Dynamic Deep Network models, continuous learning, and adaptive algorithms.
2. Design and implement Dynamic Deep Network architectures using popular deep learning frameworks.
3. Collect and preprocess datasets that exhibit changing data distributions.
4. Develop algorithms for "on the fly" training and inference, incorporating new data into the model.
5. Evaluate the performance of the Dynamic Deep Network models on the changing data distributions.
6. Apply the dynamic methodology to practical use cases, such as anomaly detection or predictive maintenance.
7. Assess the effectiveness of the dynamic models compared to static models in these use cases.
